Got the idea from [here](http://abstrusegoose.com/51) (Abstruse Goose webcomic).

You enter the month and year of your birth on the gui, and it shows the months of your life in visual form. Each symbol corresponds to a month.

I wrote this script a while ago, for ahk classic, but it should work with newer versions.
